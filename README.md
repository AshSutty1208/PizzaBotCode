# Slice Code Challenge

## Instructions on PizzaBot

PizzaBot always starts at location 0,0

To use this, please open Android Studio and go to the PizzaBotViewModelTest class to test.

At the top of this class there is a test function which is there for you to modify as you see fit.

You may remove and add drop off locations from the array list as you would like, you can change 
the grid size as you like.

Any drop off locations that have an X & Y position that are greater than the size of the grid
will be dropped from the list and will not be delivered to.

If want to see the pizza bot in action you can also run the test in Debug mode and logs will
be printed in the console which will indicate the pizza bots position and what movement it made.

Have fun!
